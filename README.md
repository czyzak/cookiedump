### Description ###

The cookidump program allows you to dump all recipes on [Cookidoo](https://cookidoo.pl) websites (available for different countries) for offline and posticipate reading.
Those recipes are valid in particular for Thermomix devices.
In order to dump the recipes, a valid subscription is needed.

The initial concept of this program was based on [auino/cookidump](https://github.com/auino/cookidump).

The read_recipes program read all recipes from downloaded html files and convert them into one excel file. 
Its purpose is to make foundation for further study of food preferencies.

### ToDo ###

Use multiprocessing to make cookidump faster.
